Opensteer is a well known library used for autonomous steering behaviors in games. It was developed by Craig Reynolds from SCEI and has been used in many commercial and gaming projects.

There has been no port of this fantastic library to Flash and since, Papervision3D and as3 are growing to be a larger market, I decided it was time, I tried porting it.
